General:
- Normally it's split in Design/Impl/Performance but here Design and Impl are very close
  so structure it as Design+Impl/Performance? (Could they be seperated?)

Introduction:
- Add example stating use case e.g. that cable is still seconds faster than streaming
- Actually state what a relay is doing (maybe do this in Background?)


Background:
- Add separate part for MoQ

Proposed Setup:
- Whenever there were design decisions with multiple possibilities also say other
  possibilities and explain why the chose one is used

Testing and Results:

Future Work and Conclusion:
