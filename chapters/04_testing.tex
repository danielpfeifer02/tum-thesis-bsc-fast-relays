\chapter{Testing}\label{chap:testing}

In this chapter, we will be discussing the way we tested our prototype
implementation and the results we obtained from these tests.
We will mainly consider basic metrics such as delay reduction and 
CPU utilization to ensure the fundamental impact of our prototype
is analyzed.
Further testing might be especially interesting after the integration
of a working congestion handling mechanism into our prototype.
