\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary_ch3}

In this chapter, we have presented our approach to designing a relay, that 
is based on eBPF forwarding.
We examined the details of the necessary changes to the underlying QUIC library 
and explored the specific requirements and challenges involved in designing such a system.
All this led us to a detailed explanation, which provides the basis for a 
prototype implementation we developed.
In the upcoming chapter, we will use this prototype to evaluate the 
performance of our relay design compared to a more traditional system.
