\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary_ch3}

In this chapter, we have presented our approach of designing a relay, that 
is based on eBPF forwarding.
We dove into details of necessary changes to the underlying QUIC library
and we looked at specific requirements and challenges that occur when
designing such a system. 
All this led us to a detailed explanation, which provides the basis of a 
prototype implementation we developed.
In the upcoming chapter we will use this prototype to evaluate the 
performance of our relay design compared to a more traditional system.
