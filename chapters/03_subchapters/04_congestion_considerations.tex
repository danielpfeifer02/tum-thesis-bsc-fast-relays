\subsection{Client Congestion}
Already hinted at in figure~\ref{fig:forward-registration} it is shown that once a packet is 
registered there will also be a map update that will be triggered by the congestion controller.
This map update will tell the eBPF egress program how much data it is allowed to send out. 
In figure~\ref{fig:forward-registration} this is visualized exemplary as ``Bytes per Second Limit''
but the idea is that both the function determining how limits and thresholds are calculated from 
the information of incoming packets as well as the actual handling within the egress program 
will be application specific and defined by the relay engineer.
