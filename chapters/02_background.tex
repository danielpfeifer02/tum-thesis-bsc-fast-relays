\chapter{Background and Related Work}\label{chap:background}

In this chapter we will look at some technologies and concepts 
that will be important for the understanding of the following chapters.
We will look at the QUIC protocol, which was our choice for the 
transport layer, eBPF, which we used for implementing the packet 
forwarding, Media over QUIC (MoQ), on top of which we built 
our example application, and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming as well as 
Real-time Communication, which are fundamental concepts in the area 
of media streaming.
Finally, we will mention some related work, that tackles similar 
problems and provides interesting approaches.
