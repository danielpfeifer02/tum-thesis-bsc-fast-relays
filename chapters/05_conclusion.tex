    % Mention initial questions:
    % How can we improve the performance of a relay in a media streaming scenario by using eBPF technology?
    % How can we avoid the need to direct a packet through userspace?
    % How to handle the fact that packets are heavily encrypted?
    % What communication between userspace and eBPF program is necessary to keep coherency?
    % How can our approach be generalized to other protocols?

\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chap:conclusion}

Closing this thesis, in this chapter, we will summarize and conclude our findings 
and give a brief outlook on what one could do to advance the work we have done.
Many of the initial questions we posed in the introduction have been answered
but some areas, even though briefly touched upon, will require from further research.
