\section{Structure of this Thesis}\label{sec:structure_of_thesis}

Initially this thesis will provide some overview of the current state of the art in networking (especially in the context of media streaming), 
eBPF technology and the QUIC protocol.
We will then look at some related work that has been done in this field and that is relevant or similar to our approach.
What follows will be a detailed description of the setup that allowed us to improve relay performance, mentioning the 
eBPF setup, any library modifications that were necessary and general techniques to handle state management towards the 
clients.
Afterwards we will provide a basic performance analysis of our setup to show current improvements and limitations.
Finally we will conclude with a summary together with some ideas for future work in this field.
