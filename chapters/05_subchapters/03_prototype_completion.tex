\section{Prototype Completion}\label{sec:prototype_completion}
As mentioned already during the setup description, our prototype 
does leave out some parts of the proposed design.
Despite them not being essential for our proof of concept,
both in functionality and performance, they are still important
for a final product that is intended to be used in a real-world
scenario.
\\
Future work could focus on finalizing the prototype by researching 
and implementing best practices for the areas of congestion handling
and retransmission management, among others.
