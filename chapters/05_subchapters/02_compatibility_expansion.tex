\section{Compatibility Expansion}\label{sec:compatibility_expansion}
This thesis used the QUIC protocol together with media over QUIC (MoQ)
to demonstrate how fast-relays that circumvent userspace by utilizing
BPF programs can be designed.
However, generally speaking the design of fast-relays is not limited to
any of these protocols and could be expanded given modifications to 
necessary fields are possible (i.e.~not prevented by encryption) and
there is a way to encode the priority of a packet in the packet itself.
The latter point could always be realized by using part of the payload
which forces a deeper packet inspection within the BPF program but 
avoids the need to fit the priority into the header of an existing 
protocol.
