\section{Compatibility Expansion}\label{sec:compatibility_expansion}
This thesis used the QUIC protocol together with media over QUIC (MoQ)
to demonstrate how fast-relays, which circumvent userspace by utilizing eBPF programs, can be designed.
However, generally speaking, the design of fast-relays is not limited to
any of these protocols and could be expanded, given modifications to 
necessary fields are possible (i.e.~not prevented by encryption), and
there is a way to accommodate the priority of a packet in the packet itself.
The latter point could always be realized by using part of the payload
which forces a deeper packet inspection within the BPF program but 
avoids the need to fit the priority into the header of an existing 
protocol.

Expanding our approach to other protocols could be interesting for 
many areas outside of media streaming, examples being gaming, 
telesurgery or financial services where a delay-decrease of 
microseconds could help make a system more deterministic and 
thus more reliable.
