\chapter{Introduction}\label{chapter:introduction}

Whenever we want to enter today's digital world, one metric is crucial: speed.
With very optimized and fast networks in place, we have already reached a point where providing faster information
delivery is highly non-trivial.
The need for speed has even led to the development of new standards, such as QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections). 
Those new standards aim to improve the shortcomings of the most fundamental protocols of the internet, one of them
being TCP, which have been around more than 40 years. 
\\
Besides optimizing old standards, one other opportunity to speed up packet delivery is closely related to the way 
computers process data.
The ISO/OSI model, which is a foundational concept in networking, provides ``a common basis for the coordination 
of standards development for the purpose of systems interconnection''~\parencite{iso-osi-standard}.
As one can imagine, such a ``common basis'', even though conventient for large scale systems, can cause unnecessary
overhead.
In some cases additional speed-ups can be achieved by using more application-specific approaches.
This thesis will consider one of such cases and explore the possibilities of avoiding or delaying certain processing
steps of the ISO/OSI model in order to increase the overall speed of a network relay.
