\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary_ch2}

In this chapter we have introduced some prerequisites for the 
upcoming one.
We have looked at the QUIC transport protocol and the MoQ protocol, which is 
based on top of QUIC\@.
We have also mentioned eBPF and presented two different concepts in the 
realm of streaming, namely RTC and ABS\@.
In the next chapter, we will combine these concepts to create a 
relay design that is capable of traffic forwarding.
We will do so by first mentioning necessary changes to the library 
implementing the QUIC standard, then we will explain our proposed eBPF setup 
and finally, we will go into detail on special considerations like 
userspace synchronization or congestion related topics.
