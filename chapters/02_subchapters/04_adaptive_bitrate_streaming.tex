\section{Adaptive Bitrate Streaming}\label{sec:adaptive_bitrate_streaming}
Multimedia streaming is a big part of the internet and many optimizations have
been developed to improve the quality of service for the end-users.
This includes considering (in real-time) parts of the clients connection state, 
such as available bandwith, and adapting the rate at which a server sends data.
Such a process is called `Adaptive Bitrate Streaming' and is employed in many 
of todays streaming setups.
An example setup can be seen in~\autoref{fig:adaptive-bitrate-streaming} where
the an encoder creates streams with different resolutions and edge server that 
manages the connections to the clients can switch between those streams based 
the connection state of a specific client.
Youtube and Netflix are examples where, although more complex, similar setups
are used to provide a better user experience.

% The way the example implementation of fast-realys in this thesis is set up,
% is that the video server will encode into each packet its priority.
% For example I-frames have a high priority while P-frames have a lower
% priority.
% The relay then can decide not to forward certain packets to a client if
% the client is experiencing congestion.
