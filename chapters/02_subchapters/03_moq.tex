\section{Media over QUIC (MoQ)}\label{sec:moq_bg}

\iffalse % TODO: remove (only notes)

Notes on: https://www.ietf.org/blog/moq-overview/

Target: live streaming, real-time collaboration, gaming, etc.

Good scaling capabilities cause high latency
Low latency systems have poor scaling capabilities

MoQ aims for low latency and high scalability
Built on top of raw QUIC (or WebTransport)

Maybe add quote from https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/moq/about/

Publisher / Subscriber model
Support for many formats, rate adaptation, cache friendly mechanisms, etc.
Relays function as caches for lower latency and higher quality

Took approaches from RTP (real-time stuff), HLS/DASH (scaling)

If many downstream requests for same data, relay only needs one copy

Media content can be end-to-end encrypted but relay can still access metadata
like priority field - this is similar to our setup.
% TODO: how can these fields still be accessed? are they just not encrypted?
Priority can be used when caching or when forwarding under congestion.
The MoQ can drop or delay certain media if necessary.

VoD consumption >> live streaming but live makes up most of peak traffic

MoQ will have great influence on real-time collaboration infrastructure like 
Zoom, Teams, etc.~and live streaming platforms like Twitch, YouTube, etc. 

low latency, high fan out, high scalability is pretty much ideal for most apps.

(Also psychological improvement since latency problems tend to be blamed on the 
other party, not the network.) % TODO: prolly no fit in this section?

% \subsection{What is Media over QUIC (MoQ)?} % TODO: maybe not needed
On the application layer, we will use the Media over QUIC (MoQ) protocol which 
is, as of summer 2024, still in the process of standardization by the IETF~\parencite{moq-charter}.
MoQ targets live-streaming applications like Twitch or YouTube Live and real-time collaboration 
applications like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet.
It is built on top of the QUIC protocol with the possibility of using WebTransport
for browser support.
A general publisher/subscriber model is used, and the draft tries to combine
performant approaches from protocols like RTP (for real-time features) and HLS/DASH
(for scalability).

\subsection{Solving Scaling versus Latency}
For a long time now, there have been two main system requirements with regard to 
media-data-transmission-protocols and -setups.
One is low latency, while the other is high scalability~\parencite{what-is-moq}.
Systems of the former include real-time collaboration tools like Zoom, Teams, or Meet.
The latter are often needed by huge platforms like Twitch, YouTube, or Netflix, which aim to 
reach millions of users simultaneously.
The one thing both have in common is that it turns out to be difficult to incorporate both 
low latency and high scalability into a system at the same time~\parencite{what-is-moq}.
The MoQ protocol tries to solve this by providing a low-latency and
highly scalable setup.
To achieve this, it supports performance-enhancing approaches like relay caching or support 
for adaptive rate mechanisms. % TODO: other things that are used to achieve this?

\subsection{Design of a MoQ Relay}
The charter of the IETF working group~\parencite{moq-charter} describes what MoQ, and therefore also a relay that wants to meet the MoQ requirements, needs to support.
These requirements for the publication- and distribution setup mention the support of 
multiple formats, dynamic rate adaption mechanisms (e.g.~used for congestion handling),
as well as cache-friendly mechanisms.

    \caption[MoQ relay architecture]{MoQ relay architecture.}\label{fig:moq-relay-architecture}
\end{figure}

\autoref{fig:moq-relay-architecture} gives a visualization of the rough architecture
of a MoQ relay.
It hints at key components like the relay level cache and the congestion handling
mechanism.
What one can also infer is the place of MoQ in the OSI model, namely at the application
layer, which itself builds on top of lower-level protocols like QUIC, UDP, IP, and Ethernet.

Considering the caching mechanism, the relay can cache media data to reduce internal traffic 
and improve user experience by lowering the latency of a request.
\autoref{fig:relay-non-caching} and~\autoref{fig:relay-caching} show example traffic for the 
two different approaches.
Comparing the traditional non-caching relay and a caching MoQ-relay, we can see the latter lowers 
the traffic between server and relay in case the same data is requested by multiple clients.
Cached data can also be sent out faster since the relay does not require any communication with 
the server to retrieve the data.

    \end{minipage}
    
\end{figure}

This caching mechanism fits quite naturally into our proposed eBPF setup since we will need to 
communicate packet data between kernel- and userspace anyway to keep the QUIC library in a 
consistent state.
In addition to that, the congestion-handling functionality of the MoQ relay can also
be integrated fairly easily within eBPF\@.
This is because packet dropping is ultimately one of the main use cases of plain eBPF 
programs and, as such, easy to implement.
In a later section, we will go into detail on how the eBPF setup actually uses mechanisms like 
priority fields to achieve this.

\subsection{moqtransport}
To use the MoQ protocol in our setup, we will make use of a library that implements 
the MoQ transport protocol (moqtransport or MoQT) in Go~\parencite{priority-moqtransport-repo}.
The goal of MoQT is to define a media transport protocol that is operating on top
of QUIC and WebTransport, which is providing the concrete designs that the charter of 
the MoQ working group is aiming for.
This includes, for example, the actual structure of the different message types or error handling in case 
of a wrong state.
As of writing this thesis, the MoQT draft is in its fifth version~\parencite{draft-moqtransport}.
