\section{eBPF}\label{sec:ebpf_bg}
In 1992 a technology called `Berkeley Packet Filter' (BPF) was introduced into 
the Unix kernel.
By using BPF it is possible to attach a small BPF-program to some pre-defined hook points in 
the network stack of the kernel and filter packets there in a stateless manner.
This provided more efficiency since the packets did not need to be copied into 
userspace anymore but could directly be processed in the kernel.
One downside to such an approach however is that BPF-programs are limited by the 
so-called `BPF-verifier' which needs to check every BPF-program for safety e.g. 
to avoid infinite loops or access to invalid memory from withing kernel space. 
Today, the initial technology of BPF has evolved into `extended BPF' (eBPF) and 
allows for more versatile use cases.

    The red loop indicates the `short-cut' that is utilized by the fast relay.
    TC hook allows redirection directly to egress while XDP hook is only available
    for ingress processing.

    based on eBPF packet-forwarding.
    This avoids the need for the packet to traverse the entire network stack of the relay 
    up to the userspace.}\label{fig:route-layering}
