\section{Summary}\label{sec:summary_ch4}

We have presented the results of comparing our newly developed 
relay design to a traditional relay system without eBPF usage.
We were able to show that the idea of delaying any non-essential
application-layer processing until after the packet was forwarded
does provide a performance benefit, while utilizing a similar 
amount of CPU resources.
The fact that our system works also showed that eBPF is capable of 
providing basic relay functionality despite possible limitations
due to its verifier.
In the following chapter, we will conclude our work and provide
an outlook on future work that can be done in this area.
